// Below is a a list. Why is this a confusing way to store data?
var slance651 = ["Steven", "Lance", 32, "Brown", "Brown", "6 foot 0 inches", 190, 8, "slance@democracyprep.org", "(651)-555-5555"]

// 1. Let's turn this data into a list! A list is a variable, but instead of [ ] we use { }. Each value gets written as a name: value pair and each name: value pair is sperated by a comma. An example object is commented out below.

// var myFirstObject = {
//   favFood: "Pizza",
//   favNumber: 8,
//   favSinger: "Beyonce",
//   "Home State": "Minnesota",
// }





// 2. CREATE: Make an object called myInfo and store at least 5 things about yoursel in the list (e.g. First Name, Last Name, etc.). Make sure all name: value pairs are seperated with commans and all name items are enclosed in quotation marks!



//3. READ: Print out your first name from myInfo using [] notation and you age using . notation


//4. UPDATE: Add your favorite TV show to your myInfo object.
// Add a key of sport and value of basketball


// Update a value in an object


// 5. DELETE: Delete your age from the myInfo object.



// 6. ITERATE: Print out each person's favorite superhero with a sentence like "steven likes wonder woman", "taylor likes Jessica Jones", etc.)
var superheroes = {
  steven: "Wonder Woman",
  taylor: "Jessica Jones",
  danny: "Ms. Marvel",
  gabe: "Supergirl",
  sara: "The Hulk",
  shana: "Black Panther"
}






//7. ITERATE: You want to deliver a special message if the person likes Black Panther. If the person likes Black Panther say "______ loves the best superhero ever: Black Panther" otherwise say "_____ likes ______"
